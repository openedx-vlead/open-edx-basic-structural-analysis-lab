<p align="justify">           Plates subjected only to in-plane loading can be solved using two-dimensional plane stress theory. On the other hand, plate theory is concerned mainly with lateral loading. One of the differences between plane stress and plate theory is that in the plate theory the stress components are allowed to vary through the thickness of the plate, so that there can be bending moments,           </p> <p> <a href="http://bsa-iiith.virtual-labs.ac.in/exp6/Exp-6 Plates.pdf" target="_blank">Read More</a> </p>
